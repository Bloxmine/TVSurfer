I'd be glad to create a comprehensive README.md for your Git repository:

**Title**

```
Simple TV Channel Switcher
```

**Description**

This code creates a basic web interface that simulates a classic TV experience. It allows users to:

  - View videos on different channels.
  - Change channels using buttons.
  - Display the current channel number briefly when switching.
  - Keep track of elapsed time (simulated, not based on real-time).

**Features**

  - Simple HTML structure defining the user interface.
  - JavaScript code for:
      - Channel switching functionality.
      - Updating the current channel display.
      - Simulating a basic timer.

**Installation**

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have a web server environment set up (e.g., Apache, Node.js).
3.  Place the HTML file (`index.html`) and the JavaScript file (`js/tv.js`) within your web server's document root directory.
4.  Create a folder named `images` and place the `TV.png` image inside it.
5.  Create a folder named `video` and place your video files (`video1.mp4`, `video2.mp4`, etc.) within it.

**Usage**

1.  Open the project in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost/[your_web_server_directory]/index.html`).
2.  Click the "Channel Up" or "Channel Down" buttons to switch channels.

**Notes**

  - The `videoUrls` array in `js/tv.js` currently holds static video paths. A database is considered for the future.
  - The timer functionality is a basic simulation that doesn't currently track actual time. It just counts.
